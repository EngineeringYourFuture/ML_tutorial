# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks illustrating the use of various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Notebooks

1. [Logistic Regression](ML_code/2A_Logistic_Regression.ipynb) - This notebook covers the implementation of logistic regression, a basic algorithm used for binary classification problems.

2. [Multi-Layer Perceptron Assignment](ML_code/2B_MultiLayer_Perceptron_Assignment.ipynb) - In this assignment, we explore the use of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), a type of artificial neural network.

3. [Convolutional Neural Networks](ML_code/3A_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.ipynb) - This notebook introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning models most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

4. [Convolutional Neural Networks Assignment](ML_code/3B_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Assignment.ipynb) - This assignment provides hands-on practice in implementing and training CNNs.

5. [Natural Language Processing](ML_code/4A_Natural_Language_Processing.ipynb) - This notebook introduces basic concepts and techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.

6. [Reinforcement Learning](ML_code/5A_Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb) - In this notebook, we explore the concepts of reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment, by performing certain actions and observing the results.

7. [Reinforcement Learning Assignment](ML_code/5B_Reinforcement_Learning_Assignment.ipynb) - This assignment provides an opportunity to implement reinforcement learning algorithms and understand their workings in detail.
